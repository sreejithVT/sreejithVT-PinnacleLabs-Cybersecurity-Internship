# 🔐 Pinnacle Labs – Cybersecurity Internship Project (Python Django)

This repository contains a Django-based web application developed as part of my **Cybersecurity Internship** at **Pinnacle Labs**, conducted from **March 13, 2025** to **April 12, 2025**.

## 📝 Internship Overview

During this 4-week virtual internship, I designed and implemented a secure, modular Django web application featuring custom cybersecurity tools. The application provides a user-friendly interface to perform real-world security tasks such as encryption, keylogging, and password analysis.

## 🚀 Web-Based Tools Developed (Python Django)

### 🔸 Text Encryption Module
- Web form input to encrypt/decrypt text using symmetric encryption
- Built-in key management

### 🔸 Image Encryption Module
- Upload and encrypt images with a generated key
- Secure image rendering and decryption via frontend

### 🔸 Keylogger Module
- Captures keystrokes (for demo/educational purposes)
- Displays captured logs in the admin panel or protected view

### 🔸 Password Analyzer
- Analyzes entered passwords for strength and vulnerabilities
- Highlights use of weak, predictable patterns
